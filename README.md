# Blue Learn Hackathon

# Project Name
Seekocity - Curated Roadmap And Resources To Help Get Started.

## About the Project
we are building a web app where newbies can search resources to learn new skills and experienced people can also share useful resources.
e.g. - Let's say Bob is a experienced react developer and Jack wants to study react development. So in our web app Bob can share some useful resources. So that newbies like Jack can find good resources to learn new skills.

## Technologies used
We've used html, CSS and JavaScript as the languages to code our webapp.  Using frameworks like Expres.js and libraries like Node.js we've built the backend. As the database we've used MongoDB.

 ## Steps for installation
1. Install Node.js on your local machine.
2. Add your own API keys in .env file.
3. And.....You're good to go!

 ## App/Web link if hosted (recommended but optional)
Still trying to host. Will get it done before final pitch.
